          At cooper our mission is to make the world a more co-operative place. We want to help as many co-ops as the world has to offer and help workers find alternatives that help create a more supportive and loving world <u style=" text-decoration-thickness: 2px;">for all people.</u>  
        </p>   
        <p>  
          We started our mission in 2022 and are now still on course to reach more and more workers and co-ops everyday. We work to provide the best customer service as humanly possible and are continually striving at that. To all those in the work force or co-ops needing workers we are here for you. We work excluvsively with co-ops only as our name may suggest and are part of the co-op federation international. 
        </p>

          Lastly we thank all the people that helped us get to where we are today and all our future helpers to come. With out their co-operation none of this would be possible and we wish to do the same for you and the many others to come. Stay well and let's cooperate!
